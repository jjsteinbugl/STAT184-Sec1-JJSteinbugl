# Introduction:
This repo examines the surivival rate of the COVID 19 disease based on two factors: vaccination status and age group. It uses multiple comparative graphs to see if one or both of these factors has any effect on the survival rate of those who test positive for covid.
# Implementation:
Using R, I examined the data to see the mortality rates of the study population, specifically age group individually, vaccination status individually, and then both at the same time.
# Results:

In conclusion, from this data we can determine that the list from highest mortality rate to lowest mortality rate is:

-   Unvaccinated age 50+

-   Vaccinated age 50+

-   Unvaccinated below 50

-   Vaccinated below 50

    From these results, we can see that the bigger factor in COVID mortality rate is age, where the older a person is the more fatal COVID will be. But, vaccination status also is a factor, where we can see that people who are unvaccinated are more susceptible to COVID and have a higher mortality rate.
